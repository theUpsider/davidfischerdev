        <h2>Personal Data</h2>
        <h3>Data Collection and Use:</h3>
        <p>
          The website does not collect any personal data directly from visitors. There are no forms to submit personal
          information, nor are there any analytics tools tracking user behavior.
        </p>

          The only third-party service integrated is Google Fonts for typography purposes. Google Fonts may collect
          information about the fonts being served to your web browser. For details on Google's privacy practices,
          please refer to Google's privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h2>User Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Since no personal data is collected, the typical user rights under data protection regulations (e.g., access,
          rectification, deletion) do not apply here. However, should you have any concerns or inquiries about privacy,
          please feel free to reach out.

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          Protecting the limited information that is indirectly involved through third-party services (like Google
          Fonts) is important to us. While we do not control these third parties, we aim to use reputable services that
          prioritize user privacy and data security.
